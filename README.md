React E-Commerce Application using dummy JSON data.
This project demonstrates continued development of my react skills.
I'm using more hooks such as useEffect, useEffect, and useRef.
I've also been learning more about npm and node. 
In this project I use emailjs to setup a contact form that sends me an email with a message.
I've recently completed a course on responsive design and am implementing those concepts, including media queries and responsive image resizing.
